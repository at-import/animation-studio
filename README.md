Animation Studio
================

A Compass extension for recreating traditional animation techniques with CSS3 animations.

#Taking the pain out of cell animation
Using the magic of the `steps()` animation timing function, we can create [walkcycles](http://codepen.io/rachelnabors/pen/bpAJH) [and](http://codepen.io/rachelnabors/full/rCost) [more](http://lessconf.lesseverything.com/index_old.html). But the method requires careful sprite sheet creation and positioning calculations. It does not lend itself to a fast-paced environment or iterative development process.

Our first goal is to take the labor out of creating cell animations with `steps()`: Pass in your images and a few parameters and get a sprite sheet and CSS rules in return!

#Possible Future Goals
* Stacked animations helpers
* [Cut outs](http://codepen.io/rachelnabors/pen/kEeBl) helper
* Show/hide shortcuts
* Scene transitions
* Stage stack managers
